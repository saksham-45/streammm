# streammm / streamaid

Low-latency **native-res 30 fps screen streaming** (capped at 4K, never upscaled): capture on your machine, play in any browser, fan out through **Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects**.

The origin is a **Rust** binary (`cargo run`). It encodes with ffmpeg (VideoToolbox on macOS, libx264 elsewhere) and delivers **WebSocket** fMP4 — not HTTP progressive download. That is the difference between localhost looking fine and Cloudflare looking like a stalled VOD. Optional **microphone AAC** muxes into the same fragments when enabled in Settings.

## Why WebSocket (not `/stream.mp4` through a tunnel)

`cloudflared` buffers proxied HTTP unless `Content-Type: text/event-stream`. A live `video/mp4` body is held until the connection dies. WebSocket (`/stream.ws`, and the Worker `/publish` → `/watch` path) is not buffered that way.

The Worker also means **one upload** from home (the publisher) and **N viewers** at the edge.

## Quick start (this computer)

```bash
# ffmpeg on PATH. macOS: Screen Recording permission for the capturing app.
cargo run --release
# open http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

On this Mac the origin is a **LaunchAgent** (`com.streamaid.origin`). It stays up across terminal/chat sessions and login, and only stops when you unload it:

```bash
# start (and keep running)
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.streamaid.origin.plist

# stop — this is the off switch
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.streamaid.origin
```

Killing the process is not enough — `KeepAlive` will restart it. Logs: `logs/origin.out.log`. If capture is black after a reboot, allow **Streamaid** under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording.

`./config.json` is created with defaults if missing (gitignored).

| Default | Value |
|---------|--------|
| Encoder | H.264 (`ffmpeg`), High profile, no B-frames |
| Bitrate | 20 Mbps CBR, 0.5 s VBV (up to 50 Mbps in Settings) |
| GOP | 15 frames (~0.5 s join / live edge) |
| Size | cap **3840×4320**, **never upscale**, lanczos only if the display is larger |
| Displays | Settings picker + clickable **all-monitors map**: live thumbnail of the captured screen (animation-frame paint), and ~15 fps JPEG previews of the others from a persistent ffmpeg per inactive display; `Capture screen N` maps to `CGGetActiveDisplayList()[N]` so clicks hit the captured screen |
| fps | 30 |
| Audio | Off by default. Settings **Capture audio** muxes AAC into the live fMP4 (H.264/HEVC, macOS) and **reveals an audio device picker** (default mic, or BlackHole/Loopback for system audio). Watchers get an **Unmute** control (autoplay starts muted). |

## Global watch link (OTP PIN)

1. Keep the origin running on the capture machine.
2. Deploy the Worker (below).
3. Set origin `cloudflare.publish_url` / `watch_url` (or the Settings fields in the UI). The **publish** URL still includes `STREAM_TOKEN` (that is the stream-key secret; do not put it on the public watch page).
4. Share the Worker homepage with **no token in the URL**:

```
https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/
```

The host UI (`http://127.0.0.1:8080`) shows a live **6-digit PIN** (about 5 minutes; regenerate from Settings / `POST /api/otp`). The remote person types that PIN on the Worker page or localhost login overlay. Redeem issues a short-lived `streamaid_session` cookie. Wrong PINs are 401 and rate-limited.

`STREAM_TOKEN` stays the publisher secret (`npx wrangler secret put STREAM_TOKEN`). It is not the human watch password.

The Worker homepage is a player with PIN unlock, **Have AI use this computer**, and a screen analysis + Ask sidebar. `/watch` is the viewer WebSocket (session); `/publish` is ingest from the origin; `/health` is public.

## Remote computer use

Remote control is **off by default**. On the origin UI, enable:

- **Allow remote computer use** — the remote watcher can click (left/right/middle), drag, scroll, type, use modifier shortcuts (⌘/Ctrl+C), paste clipboard text, paste files, and **drop files** onto the session. Copy on the host is pushed to the watcher (text, PNG images up to 128 MB, and Finder file copies into the inbox with a Save control on the watch page — never truncated; large PNGs go in 24 KB chunks, and a too-large image is rejected rather than truncated). Watchers can paste PNG or other images (JPEG/WebP are converted to PNG) and paste non-image files into the host inbox. Files land in the origin `inbox/` folder (next to `config.json`, up to 2 GB, 24 KB chunks streamed from `File.slice` and appended to disk, resumes from `.part` after a drop), are copied onto the host **Desktop**, **and** are placed on the host pasteboard as Finder files so Cmd-V pastes them into another folder. Get/download streams the file from disk instead of buffering it in RAM. On the watch page, Get uses `showSaveFilePicker` so chunks write to disk; Safari/Firefox fall back to `GET /api/files/download`, which the Worker streams from the origin. Kill switch: uncheck it.
- **Allow AI computer use** — the same watcher can submit a task in **Have AI use this computer**. The origin loops TYPE_SNAP JPEG → vision model JSON actions → the same injector (click/right-click/drag/type/key/paste/clipboard PNG/inbox file). **Cancel AI** on the origin UI (`POST /api/computer-use/cancel`) stops a running loop.

macOS: grant **Streamaid** Accessibility (and Input Monitoring if prompted) in System Settings → Privacy & Security, in addition to Screen Recording. CI tests use a fake injector; they never post real HID events.

One remote controller at a time. The origin UI shows a **REMOTE SESSION** banner with **End** (`POST /api/control/release`) while someone is driving. Local host input / the kill switch always wins.

Control path: viewer WebSocket JSON → Durable Object → publisher WebSocket → origin injector. Type-4 LLM snapshots still never go to viewers.

Analysis does not call DeepSeek until you attach a key:

```bash
cd cloudflare
npx wrangler secret put DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
```

Until then the APIs return `503` with setup instructions. The origin already publishes a JPEG snapshot (`type 4`) about every 8 seconds while capturing. Viewers never receive those snapshots — they stay in the Durable Object for the model.

## Cloudflare deploy

```bash
cd cloudflare
npm install
npx wrangler login          # once
npx wrangler secret put STREAM_TOKEN
npx wrangler deploy
```

Then on the origin (UI Settings, or `POST /api/config`):

```json
{
  "cloudflare": {
    "publish_url": "wss://<your-worker>.workers.dev/publish?token=<STREAM_TOKEN>",
    "watch_url": "wss://<your-worker>.workers.dev/watch"
  }
}
```

Restart the origin after changing publish URL if it was already connected.

Optional: `cloudflare/cloudflared.yml` if you want the **UI** on a tunnel hostname. Do not send HTTP `/stream.mp4` through the tunnel.

## Streams (origin)

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `GET /stream.ws` | **Primary.** Binary: `1` = fMP4 init, `2` = fragment, `3` = JPEG, `4` = LLM snapshot (origin → Worker only) |
| `GET /stream.mp4` | LAN fallback, `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` (buffered on Tunnel) |
| `GET /stream.mjpeg` | MJPEG compatibility |

Player live-edge is ~0.45 s with `playbackRate` catch-up. It appends by type byte, not by sniffing `ftyp` in a TCP chunk.

## API (origin)

```
GET  /                UI (shows live PIN + kill switches)
GET  /api/status      capture/stream JSON
GET  /api/config      full config        POST /api/config   apply+save
GET  /api/otp         host: current PIN   POST /api/otp     regenerate PIN
POST /api/otp/redeem  `{ "pin": "123456" }` → session cookie
POST /api/computer-use `{ "task": "…" }`  (403 unless AI control enabled)
GET/POST /api/files     inbox list / `{ "name", "data" }` (base64; 403 unless control on)
GET  /api/files/download?name=…
GET  /api/events      SSE
GET  /api/capture-devices
```

Host token: `Authorization: Bearer`, `?token=`, or `streamaid_token` cookie (config, PIN mint). Viewer session: `streamaid_session` cookie or `?session=` (watch + computer-use). Empty token keeps open local-dev mode.

## Screen analysis (Cloudflare Worker)

The Durable Object (`StreamRoom`) stores the latest JPEG snapshot, runs vision on it, and serves Q&A on the same watch page.

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `GET /api/analysis` | Latest summary, on-screen Q&A, history, `{configured, has_snapshot, model}` |
| `GET /api/llm-status` | Whether `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is set and a snapshot has arrived |
| `POST /api/analyze-now` | Force a vision pass now |
| `POST /api/ask` | `{ "question": "…" }` → `{ answer, confidence, reasoning }` |

Model defaults (override with wrangler `vars`):

- `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` = `https://api.deepseek.com`
- `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` = `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp`

Same-origin player polls `/api/analysis` and also accepts a WebSocket JSON message `{ "type": "analysis", "data": … }` when a pass finishes.

## Tests

```bash
cargo test                 # unit + HTTP API + player contract + stress
cargo test --test stress   # 30 fps hub budget, 16 WS clients, real 1080p30 ffmpeg encode
cd cloudflare && npm test  # Durable Object: 401, fan-out, late join, publisher replace, snap isolation, 503 without DeepSeek key
```

## Layout

```
src/            Rust origin (encode, hub, HTTP/WS, publisher)
web/            local UI
cloudflare/     Worker + StreamRoom Durable Object + public player
tests/          cargo tests (HTTP API, player contract, 1080p30 stress)
```
